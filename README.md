# About this project
    When we need to make changes in the local folder and map it to the container folder volumes concepts come in handy
    docker-compose is using non- default docker file (Dockerfile.dev) this config is done under build command. 

## map volumes in command
    docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /home/node/app/node_modules -v ~/exercises/frontend:/home/node/app iamyuvi:frontend

## explanation of command :
execute docker(docker run) 
- in provide input(-i) and format mode(-t) ,
- map the local machine port with the port running inside docker container (-p machineport:containerport)
- create reference from the continaer directory to local directoty (-v localmachinedirectory:containerdirectory)
- create a placholder or inform to the docker that do not reference this particular directory to any other directory.

    why do we create placeholder?

        - while we create references in local directory node_modules does not exists, in this case container node_modules directory could be deleted. so it is the way to tell docker explicitly do not touch this particular foler when performing reference.

    why do we need to create reference?
    
        - when we make some changes in the local folder we expect it to be reflected in the output served by docker container

# modify start command on running container
 docker exec -it b582f61c8680 npm run test - run existing container with different startup command passed through terminal


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
